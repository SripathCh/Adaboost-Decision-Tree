# Enhancing Drug Activity Prediction Accuracy Using AdaBoost with Decision Trees

## Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on implementing the AdaBoost algorithm with decision trees as the base learners. The AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) algorithm is used to improve the performance of decision trees on binary classification tasks.

## Repository Contents
- `adaboost.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the setup, execution, and evaluation of the AdaBoost algorithm with decision trees.

## Features
- **AdaBoost Algorithm Implementation**: Utilizes the AdaBoost technique to enhance the classification accuracy of decision trees.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Includes plots showing the performance and improvement of the classifier.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-Learn for the AdaBoost and decision tree algorithms
- Matplotlib for generating plots
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive code execution and presentation

**Note**: This code and repository are for showcasing my projects and are not intended for external use.
